# MinimalCordFix v1.0
Made some edits and changes to get it work with latest Discord update. 

Original Author: Gibbu#1211. 
https://github.com/Gibbu/BetterDiscord-Themes/tree/master/MinimalCord

To install, download and drag and drop the css file to the themes folder on BetterDiscord\themes. 
You can also open the original MinimalCord.theme.css file (make backup of the file first) and replace the code found here.
